0. Fetch the code from `pyroms` [source repo](https://github.com/ESMG/pyroms).
1. Create a new conda environment:
``` bash
    conda create -n test_pyroms python=3.8
```
2. Follow the `ReadMe.md` in `pyroms` to install libs
3. For the `SCRIP` installation:
    1. Note to modify `makefile` to avoid link to pre-installed netCDF lib/inc by Intel/PGI for model usage, and redirect to anaconda packaged path.
    2. If `netcdf.inc` is not found in conda env path, just copy one from pre-installed netCDF include path.
