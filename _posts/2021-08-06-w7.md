### W7 Large Margin Classification

#### Notes

##### SVM - Support Vector Machine "Large Margin Classifiers"

* SVM gives computational advantages compared with Logistic Regression, easier to solve.
* Form of SVM cost function: `J=A+lambda*B` --> `J=C*A+B`
* For Linerly seperable data set, larger C, sensitive to outliers, but yields large margin.
