### W6 Evaluation 

#### Notes

##### Evaluation

* Training set (60%), cross-validation set (20%), and test set (20%).
* If a learning algorithm is suffering from high variance, getting more training data is **likely** to help.
* Small neural network is prone to underfitting

##### System Design

* Start from simple model
* Plot learning curves to decide if more data, features, etc. are likely to help
* Error analysis: (1) manually examine errors (2) what potential features could help to classify them.
* Skewed Classes: Positive examples# << Negative examples#
* Precission: `#True positive/#Predicted positive`
* Recall: `#True positives/#Actural positives`
* F<sub>1</sub> score 2*P*R/(P+R)
