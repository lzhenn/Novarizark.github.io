### W8 Unsupervised Learning

#### Notes

##### KMeans 

* Process:
    * 1. Randomly initialize cluster centroids
    * 2. Assign all data points to their nearest cluster centroids
    * 3. Move cluster centroids to the mean value of all of the samples assigned to each previous centroid.
    * 4. Repeats these last two steps until this value is less than a threshold.
    * If no sample is assigned to the k-th centroid, just eliminate that centroid.
* Optimization Objectives
    * Distortion cost function
    * Multiple random initializations to avoid local optima. For large K, not work.
    * Elbow method: Cost function J as a function of numer of clusters K.

##### Dimentionality Reduction

* Aim: 1. Data compression 2. Visualization
* Princical Component Analysis (PCA)
* Feature scaling / mean normalization before performing PCA.
* PCA procedure: 
    * 1. compute covariance matrix Sigma 
    * 2. eigen vector: [U, S, V]=svd(Sigma) or eig(Sigma)
    * 3. U=[U1, U2, ..., Uk (col)] the first k cols will represent k-dim features reduced from n-dim original features.
    * 4. z=transpose(Ureduce)*x
* Choose k with the smallest value that 99% of variance is retained.
* [U, S, V], S is used for check variance, with diagnal entries S11 S22 ... added up to check the variance.
* Do not use PCA to avoid overfitting (no info from Y)
