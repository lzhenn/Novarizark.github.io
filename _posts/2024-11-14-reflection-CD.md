(This is purely fictional. Any similarity to actual persons or events is purely coincidental.)

I was invited by Dr. J to deliver a talk in CD. Upon landing, the driver picked me up and expressed a keen interest in my experiences in the Fishing Village. He shared that his child had achieved a score of approximately 630 in high school, which holds potential for admission to a good university. He conveyed the strong pressure he felt regarding his sonâ€™s future and mentioned the efforts he and his wife had made to provide a better educational environment by relocating to CD. Meanwhile, his friends stayed in their hometown were doing well in business and finding success, which left him feeling somewhat disheartened.

He told me that his son hopes to study electronics in a famous local Univerisityu, and he desires for his son to attend a university that would ensure a stable job upon graduation. He also criticized the unfair competition young people face when trying to secure a "stable" job.

I made sure to commend his dedication and sacrifices for providing his son with a quality educational environment. I shared my journey from a small village to YT, a coastal city that offered me a wonderful educational experience and shaped who I am today. The southeastern coastal cities provide more equal opportunities and higher salaries. I encouraged him to respect his son's interests and aspirations, emphasizing the importance of seizing opportunities to make a difference. He agreed and recognized the value of embracing potential opportunities.

In contrast, I visited Dr. J the following day. He dominated our conversation, steering the discussion toward research projects and funding, emphasizing the challenges of managing a team and the critical need to secure projects and financial support. I noticed that he seemed somewhat dismissive of the current economic slowdown, although he did acknowledge the existence of unemployed individuals. He mentioned that he benefited from lower prices in ride-hailing services. When he goes out on weekends with his family, he opts for ride-hailing instead of driving his own car, valuing the convenience and cost-effectiveness.

During my visit to Dr. J, I also used a ride-hailing service. Upon getting into the car, the driver informed me that he had waited for 30 minutes before receiving my order, and the final fare was about 1.2 green coins. I wondered how much he could earn from such a ride. As we chatted, he expressed frustration that some passengers arriving from the airport refused to pay an additional fee for crossing districts, leaving him with no choice but to suggest canceling the ride.

At the dinner hosted by Dr. J, I had a brief conversation with a young staff member from the QH Institute. When she learned that I was currently working in the Fishing Village, she exclaimed, "Wonderful! You earn green paper; that is hard currency!" I was impressed by her response. She hailed from a northwestern province, in which few people can even name the major cities. Interestingly, she was equipped with an iPhone 14 or 15 Pro.

During the dinner, I also spoke with a leader from the institute, who demonstrated a broad and deep knowledge of modern history. However, I sensed a strong sense of nationalism rooted in his perspective. I couldn't determine whether this viewpoint stemmed from his professional position or from his long-term beliefs.

Finally, another driver took me to the airport. I slept for a good portion of the trip, but as we approached the airport, we engaged in conversation. He directly asked whether I had obtained the passport for the Fishing Village. I was surprised and replied that it would still be two years. He then praised the excellent educational and medical facilities in the village and encouraged my wife and me to stay there for the long-term benefits.

This experience led me to several key conclusions:

1. The economic shock primarily impacts establishments from a macro perspective, resulting in fewer available projects and funding. However, it does not significantly affect the basic income of individuals within the established system.
2. There is a deep sense of depression, high unemployment, and visible distress in the general society.
3. Stable contracted drivers working for professional pick-up service companies possess a clear understanding of the current situation. They are more concerned about their children's futures and feel optimistic about opportunities on the other side of the sea.
4. In contrast, the unstable class of ride-hailing drivers experiences much more hardship, with their outlook largely constrained by their immediate income.
5. The management board remains resistant to providing additional stimulus. There seems to be no viable path for Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) or Universal Basic Income (UBI), and the depression may deepen, potentially mirroring or exceeding the experiences of JP in the past.
